# Ambar — Sustainable Code, Smart Compilation

Ambar.Code is a modern, statically-typed ``programming language`` and ``compiler`` designed to bridge the gap between **developer productivity** and **energy-efficient execution**. 

🔗 **Pitch do Projeto:** [See your pitch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RXUyhMomso)

Built with advanced optimization strategies and adaptive compilation techniques, Ambar.Code empowers developers to write clean, high-performance code — with sustainability at its core.

---

## 🔍 Overview

As software complexity and usage grow, so does the **energy footprint** of computation. Ambar.Code was created to address this challenge by providing:

- A **simple and accessible syntax** for learners and professionals alike.
- A **compiler with built-in energy-aware optimizations**.
- **Static analysis and real-time insights** to eliminate inefficiencies before deployment.
- An architecture designed to scale across **IoT, edge devices, cloud computing**, and **high-performance environments**.

---

## 🚀 Core Features

✅ Adaptive compilation for ARM/x86 architectures  
✅ Register-level optimizations and lazy evaluation  
✅ Real-time feedback via CLI and energy-insight engine  
✅ Clean, readable syntax with modern language constructs  
✅ Integration-ready API for backend services (Spring + Hibernate)

---

## 🌍 Sustainability Goals

Ambar.Code aligns with the following Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):

- **SDG 13**: Climate Action – Reduce CO₂ footprint through smarter code  
- **SDG 4**: Quality Education – Provide accessible programming tools  
- **SDG 9 & 10**: Innovation & Inclusion – Democratize access to efficient computing

---

## 📈 Expected Impact

- Up to **15% reduction** in energy usage vs other compilers
- Comparable runtime performance to C/Rust with simpler development workflow  
- **Carbon-aware programming** practices from day one

---
